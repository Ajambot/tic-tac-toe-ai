# Tic-Tac-Toe AI using Minimax Algorithm

This project implements an AI player using the Minimax algorithm or the MonteCarlo Tree Search algorithm to play the game of Tic-Tac-Toe perfectly. The AI analyzes all possible moves and their outcomes to make the best decision in each turn.

## Usage

1. Clone the repository to your local machine:

    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/your-username/tic-tac-toe-ai.git
    ```

2. Navigate to the project directory:

    ```bash
    cd tic-tac-toe-ai
    ```

3. Run the game:

    If you want to see the minimax algorithm, run:
    ```bash
    python TicTacToe_minimax.py
    ```
    If you want to see the MonteCarlo Tree Search algorithm, run:
    ```bash
    python TicTacToe_MCTS.py
    ```

4. Follow the prompts to play against the AI
